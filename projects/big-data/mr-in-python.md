- This API allows practically any programming language (weâ€™ll focus on python)
- (Key,Value) pairs fed as a continuous stream of text with sorted keys.
- Data flows into mapper/reducer via *NIX pipes behind the scenes.
- the Developer must:
  - read data from STDIN (standard input)
  - define key,value separator
  - split and parse key and value strings to the correct data type
  - identify when keys change in the stream
  - emit by writing to STDOUT (standard output)
