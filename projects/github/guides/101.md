# What is GitHub

At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.

People around the world use GitHub to collaborate on projects ranging from software to policy documents and cookbooks. You can share your projects with the world and invite your friends to help, or you can keep your projects private and still have easy access wherever you are.

GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.

While you are collaborating, GitHub uses Git (open source, distributed version control software) to keep track of every change made to your project.

## GitHub Repositories
You will see this word “repository” a lot, so let’s talk about it. A repository is a container that holds everything related to a specific project.


# Using GitHub Issues
GitHub Issues are used to record and discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:

- Replacing email for project discussions, ensuring everyone on the team (even your future team member) has the complete story.
- Allowing you to cross-link to other Issues and Pull requests.
- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions.
- Allowing you to easily pull the right people into a conversation with @ mentions and team mentions.

# Github Features

Wiki: GitHub also has a place to create and store your relevant project documentation.
Insights: A drop-down menu option that contains links to different analytic tools for your repository. It contains the following items:
Pulse: Pulse is our project’s dashboard. It contains information on the work that has been completed and the work in progress.
Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity, including who has contributed, when the work has been done, and who has forked the repository.

#Special Files

###CONTRIBUTING.md
The CONTRIBUTING.md is used to describe the process for collaborating on the repository. The link to the CONTRIBUTING.md file is shown anytime someone begins to create a new issue or pull request.

###ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
The ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md is yet another special file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always want to gather certain types of information for bug reports, you can include it in the issue template and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.
