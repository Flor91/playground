Please follow some basic rules when adding new assets:

- Use self-describing folder names, avoid names like Others, Misc, Unclassified, etc.

- If the asset refers to only one tool / technology and it is about the learning of this tool or technology, put it into Self learning folder.

- If the asset refers to a method, architecture, model, approaching, etc., using one or more tools, please put it into an ad hoc folder, example: Neural network programming with Java must reside in Artificial Intelligence folder, rather than Java folder.
