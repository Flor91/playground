00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,000
We're just going to go through a few basic commands

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,670
for using the box.

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,660
Going through Vagrant and using the proper commands

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,500
ensures, or should ensure that your virtual machine remains

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,745
stable and usable.

6
00:00:16,745 --> 00:00:20,070
If you use any other methods or do not

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,930
do clean shutdowns of the virtual machine,

8
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,460
unexpected things could happen.

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:30,920
So first off, I'm going to open up VirtualBox

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,980
so we can see it running here in the background.

11
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,925
Here I see my virtual machine is powered off.

12
00:00:34,925 --> 00:00:38,234


13
00:00:38,234 --> 00:00:41,700
Open up a terminal.

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,630
Put it in the foreground, kind of over here.

15
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,970
CD into my directory, my custom directory, my vagrant,

16
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:53,450
and to just simply start the virtual machine or the box,

17
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,420
do a Vagrant up.

18
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:07,590


19
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,640
It'll take a little bit here, but it will start.

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,220


21
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,840
You can see what's going on here,

22
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,960
there's a preview screen here.

23
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:24,100


24
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,910
And we'll also get some feedback immediate here,

25
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,210
command line, once it's actually done starting up.

26
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:42,460


27
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,620
So it's started.

28
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:49,440
To do a clean shutdown, or clean stop of my virtual machine

29
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:55,899
we'd do a vagrant halt. OK, that's the command to run,

30
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:57,940
and that should be the command that you basically

31
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,090
run every time you're going to possibly shut down

32
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,160
your desktop, your system server, or what have you.

33
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,420


34
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:13,410
There's also a Vagrant destroy, which will basically remove

35
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,920
the virtual machine completely.

36
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,730
So it would actually remove this virtual machine here

37
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:23,520
completely, if I did a destroy, which I'm not going to do.

38
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,180
OK, so I'm going to leave it running, minimize.

39
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,560


40
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,820
So now we're going to go-- not that we have the box running,

41
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,810
we're going to go to our Python notebook that should be running

42
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:40,935
within the virtual machine.

43
00:02:40,935 --> 00:02:43,820


44
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,140
So the special port to access it, an address,

45
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:55,970
127.0.0.1:80001.

46
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,970
And there we go, our Python notebook.

47
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,070
