1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:04,790
Spark provides mllib, which is a scalable, distributed machine

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:05,680
learning library.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,020
It provides a scikit-learn like Machine Learning tool kit

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,520
and interoperates with NumPy.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,350
It provides functionality, including

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:19,520
classification, regression, and many other useful methods.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,520
In this course, in the lab, you'll

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,140
be working on a problem of collaborative filtering.

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,100
The goal here is predict user's movie ratings

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,850
based on past ratings of other movies.

11
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,530
So the way to think about this is we have a set of users.

12
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:33,810
Those are columns here.

13
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,790
And we have a set of movies, which are rows here

14
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,530
in this Ratings matrix.

15
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,600
We can model Ratings as a product of User and Movie

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,590
Feature matrices of size U by K for the User matrix and M

17
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,020
by K for the Movie Feature matrix, where in this case

18
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:51,950
K is the rank.

19
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:55,160
And we want to learn K factors for each user

20
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,160
and learn K factors for each movie.

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,770
Now, we can do this by using the Alternating Least Squares

22
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,690
method.

23
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,640
We start with random A and B vectors.

24
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,470
And then we optimize the user vectors--

25
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,030
those are the A vectors-- based on the movies.

26
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,160
And we optimize the movie vectors--

27
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,740
that's the B vector-- based on the users.

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,240
And we repeat this process until we reach convergence.

29
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,300
You'll explore this in the lab.

30
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,050
Now, if you're interested in learning more

31
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,960
about Spark and Machine Learning,

32
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,260
I encourage you to take the Scalable Machine Learning

33
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:30,667
course, which starts June 22, 2015.

34
00:01:30,667 --> 00:01:31,167
