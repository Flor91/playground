00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,330


1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:04,170
The "R" language is an evolution of the "S" language

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,580
that was developed at Bell Labs for exploratory data analysis.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,480
The idea is to allow interactive exploration and visualization

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,030
of data.

5
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,560
And it's the preferred language for statisticians

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,630
and used by many data scientists.

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,700
Its features include being the most comprehensive collection

8
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,230
of statistical models and distributions,

9
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,760
and also CRAN, which is a very large repository of open source

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,900
statistical models.

11
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,800
Now, let's talk about some definitions.

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,930
The mean of a set of values is the average of the values,

13
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,190
and the variance is a measure of the width of a distribution.

14
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,460
The standard deviation is the square root of the variance,

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,910
and a normal distribution is characterized

16
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,740
by a mean and a variance.

17
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,480
Here we have a figure that shows an example

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,410
of a normal distribution.

19
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,840
In probability theory, the central limit theorem

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,970
states that the distribution of a sum

21
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,360
or mean of n independent identically

22
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,500
distributed random variables approaches

23
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,720
a normal distribution as the number of variables

24
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,060
approaches infinity.

25
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,990
The common parametric statistical test,

26
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,290
for example t-test and ANOVA, assume

27
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,870
that you have a normally distributed data set.

28
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,990
But they also depend on the sample mean and variance.

29
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,600
These types of tests work reasonably

30
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,180
well for data that are not normally distributed,

31
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,640
as long as the samples are not too small.
