1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:04,540
Working with tabular data introduces several challenges.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,370
The format may not be well defined.

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,270
It may be missing data values.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,070
Types may be incorrectly inferred.

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,220
So for example, if a cell contains 2, instead of 2.0,

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,420
the type might incorrectly be inferred as integer.

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,450
And then there's no support for versioning of the format,

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,765
and many other challenges that you'll have to face.

9
00:00:24,765 --> 00:00:27,220
When you have tabular data from multiple sources,

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,960
there are additional challenges that you may face.

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,920
Not every source may provide the same data,

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,090
which means that some fields may be missing.

13
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,790
There may be inconsistent data types

14
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,310
between the different sources.

15
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,200
So one file may have dollar values,

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,450
while another file has pound values.

17
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,740
There also may be inconsistent values for the same entity.

18
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,620
One file may refer to the supermarket company Walmart

19
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,000
as Wal-Mart, whereas the other file refers to them

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,902
as Walmart, all one word.

21
00:00:56,902 --> 00:00:59,430
When you get tabular data from sensors

22
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,150
there are additional challenges.

23
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,309
They may be missing fields.

24
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:03,850
For example, a given sensor might not

25
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,800
produce all of the different types of data.

26
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,610
So some sensors may produce temperature and humidity,

27
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,360
while other sensors provide temperature, humidity,

28
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,610
and light.

29
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,110
A sensor may be damaged, either permanently or intermittently.

30
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,360
And timestamps may be inaccurate or incorrect

31
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,790
between different sensors.

32
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,370
Other metadata for the sensors may also have errors.

33
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,150
For example, the location of a sensor or its identification

34
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:30,840
code.

35
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,390
And sensors may periodically go offline for a while,

36
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,100
leading to gaps in the data.
