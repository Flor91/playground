1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:04,059
Semi-structured tabular data is one of the most common data

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:05,470
formats.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,990
A table is a collection of rows and columns.

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,100
Each row has an index, and each column has a name.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,330
A cell is specified by an index name pair.

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,740
And a cell may or may not have a value.

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,780
The type of a cell is inferred from its value.

8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,240
Here's an example of tabular data.

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,620
This is Fortune 500 companies.

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,230
These are the top 500 US closely held

11
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,060
and public corporations by gross revenue.

12
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,780
What you can see from this table is that there are different

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,330
columns,-- for example, rank, company name, revenue--

14
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,550
and there are different rows for each company that's in this

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,400
tabular data.

16
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,950
Now, we can take and export this data as a comma separated value

17
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,620
file.

18
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,700
That file looks like this.

19
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,860
And it consists of a header row that

20
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,220
consists of the columns separated by commas, the column

21
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:02,010
names, and then rows consisting of values

22
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,640
for each one of those columns separated by commas.

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,220
Each company is on a different row.

24
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,500
Here's a different exported file.

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,810
This is from a protein data bank.

26
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,160
And here the format is different.

27
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:20,070
The format is the first column of a line is the field

28
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,850
name followed by values.

29
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:26,660
And field names can be repeated on multiple lines.
