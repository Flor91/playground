1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,010
In this lecture, I'll talk about programming with Spark,

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,970
the Spark Abstraction Resilient Distributed Data

3
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:15,350
sets, how you create an RDD, and the Transformations and Actions

4
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,550
that you can perform on RDDs.

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,000
And then, I'll talk about the Spark Programming Model.
