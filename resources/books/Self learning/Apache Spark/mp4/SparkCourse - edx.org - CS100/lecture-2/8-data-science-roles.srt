1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,060
Let's look at four data science roles.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,040
Two are individual.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,090
A businessperson and programmer.

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,740
And two are organizational.

5
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,300
An enterprise and a web company.

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,530
A businessperson has data sources

7
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,870
that include things like web pages and Excel spreadsheets.

8
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:23,570
Their ETL process is copy and paste between these documents.

9
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,380
Their data warehouse is often a set of Excel spreadsheets.

10
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,750
And for business intelligence and analytics

11
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,245
they use things like Excel functions, Excel charts,

12
00:00:32,245 --> 00:00:34,610
and Visual Basic.

13
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,970
A programmer has data sources that include web scraping, web

14
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,630
services APIs, Excel spreadsheets

15
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,300
that are exported as comma separated values,

16
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,920
and database queries.

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,480
Their ETL consists of lots of scripts,

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,080
like Wget, curl, Beautiful Soup, and lxml.

19
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,640
They store their data in flat files.

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,600
And their business intelligence and analytics

21
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,010
is tools, like Numpy and Matplotlib,

22
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:05,040
R, Matlab, and Octave.

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,355
The enterprise has data sources that

24
00:01:07,355 --> 00:01:11,720
include application databases, internet files, and application

25
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,200
server log files.

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,295
Their ETL is done using commercial products.

27
00:01:16,295 --> 00:01:18,390
And their data warehousing is also

28
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,420
done using commercial products.

29
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,780
And for business intelligence and analytics

30
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,730
they also use a variety of commercial and open source

31
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,570
products.

32
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,060
The web company has its data sources, application databases,

33
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,170
logs drawn from their services tier, and web crawl data.

34
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,520
Their ETL is a set of open source tools,

35
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,100
like Apaches Flume, Sqoop, Pig, Oozie, and Crunch projects.

36
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,090
Their data warehouse is also open source projects

37
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:51,970
from Apache, things like Hadoop, Hive, Spark, and Spark SQL.

38
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,980
Their business intelligence and analytics

39
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:58,590
is done using custom dashboards, like Oracle Argus and Razorflow

40
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,300
or open source tools, like R.
