00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,190
Here's another cautionary tale about data cleaning.

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,220
This is a picture from the National Center for Atmospheric

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,450
Research that shows the appearance

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,610
of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica.

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:17,185
Now when this first occurred-- was observed in 1976,

6
00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:19,060
the scientists thought that their instruments

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,460
were malfunctioning because they didn't expect to see it.

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,340
And so they rejected the data as unreasonable,

9
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,630
as a part of their data quality control algorithms.

10
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,130
But in reality, we know that that actually was

11
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,901
a real hole in the atmosphere.

12
00:00:32,901 --> 00:00:33,400
