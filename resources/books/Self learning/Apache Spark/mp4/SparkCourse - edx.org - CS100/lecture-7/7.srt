00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,090


1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:02,780
We begin with data gathering.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,500
How does the data actually enter the system?

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,210
This is part of the experimentation or observation

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,060
or collection process.

5
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,490
It can be a source of problems, including

6
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,800
issues around manual entry of information

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,220
versus automated data entry.

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,520
It can be due to approximations or surrogates,

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,140
maybe constraints in the software

10
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,810
or constraints in the hardware.

11
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,110
It can be due to a lack of uniform standards

12
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,110
for content and formats.

13
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,920
It can be due to parallel data entry.

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,110
This causes duplicates.

15
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,480
Or it can be due to measurement or sensor errors.

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,350
Some potential solutions to the data gathering problem

17
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:40,920
are to be preemptive.

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,210
Design a good process architecture that

19
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,380
builds in integrity checks.

20
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,510
Design good process management that rewards accurate

21
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,790
data entry, sharing and stewards.

22
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,750
These are the people who are responsible for data entry.

23
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,580
Also, consider being retrospective.

24
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,650
The cleaning focus should focus on things

25
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,540
like duplicate removal, or merging and purging

26
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,270
bad information, or performing tasks like name and address

27
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,660
matching, or field value standardization.

28
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,290
Also, think about a diagnostic focus--

29
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,360
automating the detection of problems

30
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,633
during the data gathering phase.

31
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:18,133
