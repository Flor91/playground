1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,680
Data quality problems can also rise during data retrieval.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,510
Exported data sets are often just a view of the actual data.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,930
And problems can occur because the source

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,190
or the need for drive data was not properly understood.

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,920
Or it can just be ordinary mistakes, for example,

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,540
performing an inner join instead of an outer join,

7
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,500
or not understanding what null values mean.

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,760
They can also be computational constraints.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,580
For example, producing the full history might be too expensive.

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,580
And so you supply a limited snapshot instead.

11
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,420
But what are the limitations of that snapshot?

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,650
Or it could be incompatibility issues, for example,

13
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,605
producing the data in ASCII instead of Unicode or UTF-8.

14
00:00:39,605 --> 00:00:42,430


15
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:47,360
Data mining and analysis can also introduce problems.

16
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,875
You need to understand what you're doing with the data.

17
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:51,750
And there can be many problems that can occur

18
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,480
during the analysis phase.

19
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,740
Scale and performance issues, confidence

20
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,210
bounds-- understanding what they are-- black boxes

21
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,090
or dart boards, being attached to a model,

22
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,970
having insufficient domain expertise,

23
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,970
or applying casual empiricism-- that

24
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,540
is, using some arbitrary number has

25
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,760
to support a pre-conception.

26
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,380


27
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,920
So for retrieval and mining, there

28
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,690
are many potential solutions.

29
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,790
For data exploration, you can try

30
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,740
to determine which models and techniques are appropriate.

31
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,220
Try to find data bugs and develop domain expertise.

32
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,890
You should perform continuous analysis to determine,

33
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,530
are the results stable?

34
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,750
If they change, how do they change?

35
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,950
And it's very important to have accountability.

36
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,320
Make analysis part of the feedback loop.
