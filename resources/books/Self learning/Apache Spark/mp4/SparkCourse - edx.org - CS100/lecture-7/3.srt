1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,960
Where do data quality problems come from?

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:04,710
Many places.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,660
For example, the source data could be dirty on its own,

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,990
or transformations that you apply to the data

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,140
could corrupt the data.

6
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,750
And this is a challenge with the complexity of the software

7
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:18,020
pipelines that we build process data for data science.

8
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,230
We can also have clean data sets that are screwed up

9
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,240
because of the integration, where

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,590
we combine multiple data sets together

11
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,140
and do that incorrectly.

12
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,960
Things that are rare errors can become frequent errors

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,140
after we perform a transformation or integration.

14
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,520
And even a clean data set can suffer

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,630
from bit rot-- that's data that loses either its value

16
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,490
or accuracy over time.

17
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,330
Or any combination of the above can

18
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,870
cause data quality problems.

19
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,590
So again, looking at the big picture,

20
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,770
where does dirty data come from?

21
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,870
It can come from the extract, transform,

22
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,670
and load process, where we have to deal with integrating data

23
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,320
from multiple different data sources, such as application

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,680
databases, files, and logs.

25
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,590
We need to clean this data when we move it

26
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,600
into our data warehouse.

27
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,099
