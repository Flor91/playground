1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,710
There are many different types of dirty data problems

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:04,890
that we can run into.

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,720
For example, parsing the text from a text file into fields

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,590
may have trouble because there are different issues

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,300
with the separators.

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,140
The naming conventions that we use

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,070
can also cause problems with entity recognition.

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:22,970
For example, abbreviating New York City as NYC.

9
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,680
We may have missing information, like a required

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,600
field-- for example, a key field that we're

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,010
using for tabular data.

12
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,040
We also may have violations of what's

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,440
called the primary key in a database, when

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,970
we move from unstructured to structured data,

15
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,620
or when we're trying to integrate additional data

16
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,590
into our database.

17
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,610
We may have licensing or privacy issues

18
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,690
that prevent us from using data the way that we'd like to.

19
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,170
We may have different representations for data.

20
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,820
Some people may refer to the data as "2" numerically,

21
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,050
or others written out as "t-w-o."

22
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,950
Fields maybe too long and truncated

23
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:02,110
during the integration process.

24
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,124
We may have duplicate or redundant records

25
00:01:04,124 --> 00:01:07,140
that are exact matches or approximate matches

26
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,020
for each other that we have to detect and remove.

27
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,090
We also may have formatting issues.

28
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,934
Formatting issues are particularly

29
00:01:13,934 --> 00:01:15,600
a problem when we're dealing with dates,

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,190
as there are multiple different representations that we

31
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:18,690
can use.

32
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:23,130
Consider, for example, European versus American representations

33
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,140
of dates.

34
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,140
There are many meanings of data quality, and many uses of data.

35
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,000
We can use data for operations, or for aggregate analysis

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,970
or for customer relations.

37
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,310
These are all very different ways of using the data,

38
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,334
with different requirements on data quality.

39
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,000
There are also different interpretations

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,400
that we may have for data based upon the quality of the data.

41
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,910
If we don't understand all the rules behind the data,

42
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,930
it might actually be useless to have the data.

43
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,890
Then there's the question of data suitability.

44
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,170
Can we get the answer that we want from the available data?

45
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,650
We may have proxy data that's approximating

46
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,676
the data that we're looking at, or we

47
00:02:01,676 --> 00:02:04,000
may be missing the important, relevant data that we

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,970
need to make a decision.

49
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:10,550
Data quality spans a continuum, and data and information

50
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,180
are not static.

51
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,550
Data flows in a data collection and usage process

52
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,000
through multiple stages.

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,380
We gather the data, we deliver the data,

54
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,450
we store the data-- perhaps for a long time.

55
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,920
We integrate together multiple different data sets,

56
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,370
we retrieve data, and then we perform mining and analysis.

57
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,533
We're going to go through each of these steps in this lecture.

58
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:33,033
