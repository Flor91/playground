1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:03,900
Recall that we've talked about two key data management

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:04,890
concepts.

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,390
The first being a data model, which

4
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,080
is a collection of concepts for describing data.

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,450
The second is a schema, which provides

6
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,970
a description of the particular collection of the data using

7
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,560
a given data model.

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,310
Now, conventional wisdom is that only 20% of data is structured.

9
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,050
And even this number is decreasing

10
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,050
because of the rise of consumer applications, enterprise

11
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,980
search, and media applications.

12
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,600
All of these generate data that is primarily

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,710
semi-structured or unstructured.

14
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,030
In this lecture, we will look at structured data

15
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,280
where we have a specific specified

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,610
schema that we start with.

17
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,635
And then we look at the data itself.

18
00:00:43,635 --> 00:00:46,960


19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,920
In a relational database, we have the following definitions.

20
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,340
First of all, a relational database is a set of relations.

21
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,480
And there are two parts to a relation-- a schema that

22
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,250
specifies the name of the relation

23
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,380
plus each column's name and type.

24
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,680
So here we have a schema for a relation called Students.

25
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:14,490
And it consists of columns of a sid name, email, age, and GPA.

26
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,390
And each of those columns has an associated type.

27
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,540
For example, the name is type String.

28
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,370
The GPA is type Real.

29
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,070
The second part to a relation is an instance.

30
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,830
And this is the actual data at any given time.

31
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,660
And this has two characteristics.

32
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,190
The first is the cardinality or the number of rows.

33
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,480
And the second is the degree or number

34
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,150
of fields in that instance.

35
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,790


36
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,980
Now, we can add to our key data management concepts

37
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,940
a third concept, which is a relational data model.

38
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,440
And this is the most used data model.

39
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,030
A relation is a table with rows and columns.

40
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,370
And every relation has a schema that defines

41
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,775
the fields in the columns.

42
00:01:55,775 --> 00:01:58,980


43
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,950
The database is a large, organized collection of data.

44
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,470
And transactions are used to modify that data.

45
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,539
Databases model real world, like enterprises.

46
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:12,200
And so we have things like entities,

47
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,070
such as teams and games, and relationships in a database.

48
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,462
So we can say, for example, the entity A

49
00:02:19,462 --> 00:02:24,110
plays against the entity B in the World Cup,

50
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,820
where "plays against" is the relationship.

51
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,466
