00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880


1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,480
The hardware we have for big data

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,680
includes lots of hard drives and CPUs.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,292
The question is how do we organize

4
00:00:07,292 --> 00:00:09,680
these CPUs and hard drives?

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,540
One approach is to put them all in one big box.

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,050
This is a solution that people used in the 1990s,

7
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,310
but it was very expensive, because these machines were

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,650
only produced in very low volume,

9
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,920
and they were considered premium hardware.

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,110
And for today's big data, these machines are not big enough.

11
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,940
The alternative that we use for big data

12
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,950
today is consumer grade hardware.

13
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,780
It's not the gold plated servers that we put traditionally

14
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,830
into data centers, but rather, it's

15
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,930
more desktop like kinds of machines.

16
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,740
These machines are very easy to add in terms of capacity,

17
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,450
they're much cheaper for an individual CPU and disk

18
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,080
than traditional servers.

19
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,960
But they're not as reliable, and they're much harder to manage.

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,370
The trade off is we'll deal with this complexity in software

21
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,380
instead.

22
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,550
So some of the problems that we have with cheap hardware

23
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,230
include failures.

24
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:09,980
So Google's numbers are that you lose between 1% to 5%

25
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,920
of hard drives every year.

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,900
And 0.2% of memory chips per year.

27
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,750
Also, network speeds are much slower

28
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,320
than the shared memory speeds that we

29
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,220
found in those big box 1990s solutions.

30
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,050
It's much slower to read something over the network,

31
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,400
and the network can be much slower than reading something

32
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,400
from a storage drive.

33
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,330
Also, these machines have very uneven performance.

34
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:41,580
Some may be very fast, others may be very slow, sometimes

35
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,520
because they're failing.
