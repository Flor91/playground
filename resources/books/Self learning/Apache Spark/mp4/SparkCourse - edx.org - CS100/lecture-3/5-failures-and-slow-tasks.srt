1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,970
How do we deal with failures?

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,270
So in this case, the first machine has failed.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,240
The simplest solution is to just launch another task,

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,060
either on that machine if it's recovered,

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,490
or on another machine.

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,510
How do we deal with slow tasks?

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,180
So in this case, all of the other tasks finish quickly,

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,330
but the task that was running on machine one

9
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,100
hasn't finished yet.

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,590
All we do is just simply launch another task.

11
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,230
And then kill that original task.

12
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,407
And we can launch that task on a different machine

13
00:00:31,407 --> 00:00:33,490
because maybe that first machine was about to fail

14
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,840
and so it's running very slowly.
