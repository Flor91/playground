00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080


1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,170
Let's look at some of the sources of big data.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,700
Much of what we do occurs online,

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,570
and potentially we could record every click, so every website

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,210
that you click on, every ad you view, every billing event,

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,070
every fast-forward or pause while you're watching a video,

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,180
like for example this course video.

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,560
Every request that's made from a client

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,850
to a server, every transaction, every network

9
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,550
message, and every fault.

10
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,030
Anything that occurs online potentially could be recorded.

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,120
And in fact a lot of it is recorded, but very little of it

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,610
actually gets analyzed, and that's

13
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,320
why I have a picture of an iceberg on this slide,

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,050
because a phenomenal amount of data is collected

15
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,870
but only a tiny amount of that data is analyzed.

16
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,890
Another source of big data is the users.

17
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,090
User-generated content.

18
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,040
And this is a big source on the web and an even larger growing

19
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,770
source from mobile devices.

20
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:59,090
So every post that you make on Facebook or every picture

21
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,400
you send on Instagram or every review

22
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,349
that you write for Yelp or TripAdvisor or every tweet

23
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:08,860
you send on Twitter or video that you post to YouTube.

24
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,970
Now individually this user-generated content

25
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,240
is not very large, but taken across the billions

26
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,140
of internet users, it's a massive amount of data.

27
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,230
Another source of big data is health

28
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,890
and scientific computing.

29
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,140
So here on the left we have a graph

30
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,300
showing various repositories-- Wikipedia,

31
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,190
the Library of Congress, tweets per year,

32
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,750
and the Large Hadron Collider.

33
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,440
It generates more data in a year than all the other data

34
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,220
sources combined.

35
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:47,310
In the middle we have genome sequencing data.

36
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,560
Sequencing data, the cost of performing sequencing,

37
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,810
is dropping exponentially, much faster than Moore's Law,

38
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,260
so as result we're collecting more sequencing data than ever

39
00:01:59,260 --> 00:01:59,760
before.

40
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,343
And so you see the graph in the middle

41
00:02:01,343 --> 00:02:03,900
shows exponential growth in the amount of sequencing data

42
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,510
that we have.

43
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,080


44
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,130
Graphs are also an interesting source of big data.

45
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,470
These graphs include things like social networks,

46
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,220
telecommunication networks, computer networks,

47
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,060
road networks, and collaborations

48
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,170
or relationships.

49
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,650
And some of these graphs can be absolutely enormous.

50
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,900
Think about Facebook's user graph.

51
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,900
In fact, later on in this course we'll

52
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,650
look at a picture of the user graph.

53
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,350


54
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:34,440
Another source of big data is log files.

55
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,250
These are files that are generated

56
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,880
by servers around the internet.

57
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,400
So here's an example of an Apache web server log,

58
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,320
and it records every click.

59
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,050
So every time your web browser makes a request

60
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,332
to a web server, that gets recorded in the log file.

61
00:02:51,332 --> 00:02:53,040
And later on in this class we're actually

62
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,120
going to look at a log file and you're

63
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,340
going to perform some analysis on it using Spark.

64
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,990
Here's an example of a machine log file,

65
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,520
and there are hundreds of millions of machines out there.

66
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,660
Each machine is generating a log file

67
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,770
like this of the applications that run

68
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,050
or any errors that occur in those applications

69
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,552
or in the operating system or in the operating system processes.

70
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:16,510
All that gets recorded.

71
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,020


72
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,610
But an even bigger source of data

73
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,910
potentially is the internet of things.

74
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,870
Here's an example of an internet of things device.

75
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,750
And typically an internet of things device

76
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,710
has a processor, a little bit of memory,

77
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,850
and communications capability.

78
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,730
It also some sensors and sometimes and actuators.

79
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,150
So here at Berkeley, one of the research projects

80
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,956
built the internet of things device

81
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:43,330
you see in the upper right, which

82
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,370
is a little sensor mode that measures

83
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,160
humidity and temperature.

84
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,010
And they put those into the Redwood forests

85
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:52,450
we have here in California at different heights in a Redwood

86
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,430
tree.

87
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,330
Now taken individually, each sensor

88
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,442
generates a very small amount of data,

89
00:03:57,442 --> 00:03:58,900
but imagine the amount of data they

90
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,900
gets generated from an entire forest full of these sensors.

91
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,250
Here's another example of an internet of things

92
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,360
device, an RFID tag.

93
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,220
This is a California FasTrak Electronic Toll Collection

94
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,250
transponder.

95
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,940
We use it here in California to pay our tolls on the highways.

96
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,764
But it's also used to collect data that's

97
00:04:17,764 --> 00:04:19,430
used for traffic reporting, because they

98
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,920
put sensors that measure these transponders

99
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,870
all over the highways.

100
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,940
Now what we do all we have big data?

101
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,510
So let's say we have crowd sourcing.

102
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:33,000
We have lots of users that are collaborating to provide data.

103
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,610
We combine that with a physical terrain model and sensors

104
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,160
which could either be road highway sensors that

105
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,120
are embedded in the roadway or they

106
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,970
could be individual users' phones

107
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,930
running mapping applications.

108
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,172
We then assimilate together all of that data

109
00:04:47,172 --> 00:04:48,880
and we can produce a picture like the one

110
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,540
you see here at the bottom.

111
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,020
This is a map of the city of Berkeley showing

112
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,630
the traffic in the city and what's

113
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,380
interesting is in without seeing the underlying physical model

114
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,440
you could see what the major arteries and traffic ways are

115
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,380
in our city.
