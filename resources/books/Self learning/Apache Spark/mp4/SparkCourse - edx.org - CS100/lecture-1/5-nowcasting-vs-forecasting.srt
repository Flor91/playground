1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,810
Let's look at several examples of why

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,130
there's so much excitement around working with big data.

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,850
The first is nowcasting.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,520
Traditionally what people have done is forecasting.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,980
You collect a bunch of data, you build a model,

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,010
and you use that model to predict the future.

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,950
With nowcasting, you collect a lot of data

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,710
and you build a model, but instead you

9
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,070
use it to predict what's happening now.

10
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,150
So the example we're going to use is Google Flu trends.

11
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,050
The way that traditionally we determine

12
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,990
that there's an outbreak of the flu

13
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,760
is when someone's ill they go to the doctor,

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,570
the doctor fills out an incident report

15
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,910
and passes that on to their local health department, which

16
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,950
then passes it up the hierarchy through the county, the state.

17
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,450
Eventually it reaches the Centers

18
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,812
for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia.

19
00:00:47,812 --> 00:00:49,270
That process takes about two weeks,

20
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,540
so it takes a roughly two weeks to know that there's

21
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,090
an outbreak of flu, by which time

22
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,766
the outbreak may actually already be over.

23
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:59,680
With Google Flu Trends, what Google did is

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,460
they started with lots of data.

25
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,155
From 2003 to 2008, they looked at weekly search queries.

26
00:01:07,155 --> 00:01:09,890
There's about 50 million of these.

27
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,710
From the search queries, they were

28
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:16,220
able to derive 45 terms that were relevant to people

29
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,500
who are searching for flu information

30
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,300
when they had the flu.

31
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,350
They used this to build a model.

32
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,620
The model was very accurate.

33
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,710
In February of 2010 it was able to detect an outbreak

34
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,550
two weeks ahead of CDC data.

35
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,040
Initially the model was about 97% accurate,

36
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,776
but during the period from 2011 to 2013,

37
00:01:38,776 --> 00:01:42,860
it overestimated the prevalence of flu,

38
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,130
including an interval in the 2012 to 2013

39
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,900
period where it was off by a factor of two.

40
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,910
That is, Google Flu Trends estimated

41
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,120
that there were twice as many flu cases

42
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,960
as there actually were.

43
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,000
So what happened?

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,750
What happened is Google rolled out flu stories in Google News

45
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,530
during this period.

46
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,460
And so now people started reading about flu in the news

47
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,720
and searching on those stories, either

48
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,740
for those stories or things in those stories,

49
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,640
and that skewed their results.

50
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,880
Once they identified those factors,

51
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,570
they were able to take them into account

52
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,280
and the model was very accurate after that.

53
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,440
And in fact today new types of models

54
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,800
are being used to estimate which cities are most

55
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,340
at risk for the spread of the Ebola virus.

56
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,133
