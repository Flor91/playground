00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680


1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,470
This is a brief history of data analysis.

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,280
In the 1930s, Fisher proposed a design

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,530
of experiments along with his statistical tests ANOVA,

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,490
and Fisher's exact tests.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,950
He's also credited with the quotation,

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,510
"Correlation does not imply causation."

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,840
This is ironic given that Fisher was a lifelong pipe smoker,

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,200
and derided studies that showed any link between smoking

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,980
and cancer.

10
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,930
In the later 1930s, Demming proposed

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:35,110
the idea of quality control using statistical sampling.

12
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,640
Luhn, in the '50s, proposed the idea

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,350
of using indexing and information retrieval

14
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,060
methods with text data for the purposes of business

15
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,720
intelligence.

16
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,230
And Tukey, in 1977, wrote the book, Exploratory Data

17
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,500
Analysis.

18
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,870
This led to the development of the S and S+ languages,

19
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,680
along with a language you've perhaps heard of, R.

20
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,230
Dresner is a modern business intelligence proponent.

21
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,940
And in 1997, Mitchell wrote the Machine Learning book that

22
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,436
is still a bestseller today.

23
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:13,740
In 1996, two Stanford Ph.D. Graduate students

24
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,470
wrote a prototype search engine which ultimately led to Google.

25
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:23,570
And Microsoft, in 2007, released a data-driven science ebook

26
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,935
titled The Fourth Paradigm.

27
00:01:24,935 --> 00:01:27,860


28
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,160
Norvig proposed the unreasonable effectiveness of data.

29
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,140
The idea that multiple small models and lots of data

30
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:43,410
is much more effective than building very complex models.

31
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,170
And The Economist in 2010 published

32
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,090
an issue titled "The Data Deluge," ground

33
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,250
the exponential growth in data volume.

34
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:52,866
