00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,960


1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,720
The goals of this course include learning about data science,

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,765
where does Big Data come from, performing observation

3
00:00:07,765 --> 00:00:11,280
and experimentation, and the elements of data science, which

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,000
include data acquisition, data preparation, analysis,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,930
data presentation, and data products.

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,880
Another goal of the course is that you

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,595
learn how to perform data science,

8
00:00:24,595 --> 00:00:27,790
that you understand data quality and how to clean and manipulate

9
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,080
data sets, how to use and parse data representations,

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,120
and how to use basic machine learning

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,910
algorithms and libraries.

12
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,550
And that you learn how to write big data applications

13
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,780
and perform exploratory data analysis.

14
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,810
The third goal of this course is that you learn

15
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,150
to write Apache Spark programs.

16
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,090
You'll learn about the history and development of Apache

17
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,520
Spark, along with its conceptual model,

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,770
how the Spark cluster model works.

19
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:57,220
And you'll learn about Spark essentials, transformations,

20
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:01,140
actions, persistence, broadcast variables, accumulators,

21
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,060
key value pairs, and the Python spark API, pySpark.

22
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,120
You'll also learn how to debug Spark programs

23
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,270
and how to use Spark's mllib library for machine learning.

24
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,167
