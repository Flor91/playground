1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,370
This is a cautionary tale about performing data science.

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,540
In 1958 Ancel Keys started the Seven Countries Study

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,990
where he followed 13,000 subjects for anywhere

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,010
from five to 40 years.

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,940
Now as a part of this study, he produced the following graph.

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,090
This graph shows on the x-axis the fat calories

7
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,940
consumed as a percentage of total daily calories consumed.

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,633
On the y-axis it shows deaths per 1,000

9
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:36,500
for degenerative heart disease.

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,940
And this is for the time period 1948 to 1949 for men.

11
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,509
What you can see here is that it appears

12
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:47,050
to be that it's the case that there's

13
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:51,290
a correlation between the fat calories consumed

14
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:55,660
and deaths per 1,000 from degenerative heart disease.

15
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,380
However, this study has caused a lot of controversy.

16
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:05,170
In particular, he only studied a subset of the 21 countries

17
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,870
that had data.

18
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,140
He also failed to consider other factors that

19
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,930
might cause deaths from degenerative heart disease.

20
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,560
For example, if we look at the per capita annual sugar

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,820
consumption in pounds, we find that for Japan it was

22
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,500
15 pounds per person per year.

23
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,290
In Italy it was 40 pounds per person per year.

24
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:30,920
And in England and Wales it was 60 pounds per person per year.

25
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,150
So appears here that there's a correlation between per capita

26
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,890
annual sugar consumption in pounds,

27
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,280
and deaths per 1,000 of degenerative heart disease.

28
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,450
So this really emphasizes the point

29
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,220
that Fisher made that correlation does not

30
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,520
imply causation.

31
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,100
