00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,140


1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,040
Let's look at another cautionary tale

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,880
around performing data science.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,280
So in 2014, Princeton University researchers

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,000
published a paper titled, "An Epidemiological

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,930
Modeling of Online Social Network Dynamics."

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,540
The paper made quite a splash, because the last sentence

7
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,980
of the abstract was, quote, "extrapolating the best fit

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,870
model into the future predicts a rapid decline

9
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,670
in Facebook activity in the next few years."

10
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:28,930
Wow.

11
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,860
They're predicting that Facebook as we

12
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,350
know it won't exist anymore in just a few years.

13
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,820
How did they come to this conclusion?

14
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,880
They looked at Google Trends searches for Myspace.

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,420
And here on the left you see two different graphs

16
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,950
showing the results of the prevalence of Google Trends

17
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,320
searches over time and can see that there's

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,700
a peak in 2008, followed by a decline in the searches.

19
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,290
They fitted two different models to this decline

20
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,260
and then repeated that same process

21
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,500
with Google Trends searches for Facebook.

22
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:11,650
So here, you see the trends peak in 2012, followed by a decline.

23
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,190
They use that to then apply the same model

24
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,160
that they had derived from Myspace to predict

25
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,060
the future number of trends for Facebook.

26
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,530
And they arrive at the conclusion

27
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,380
that since there are going to be no more searches for Facebook

28
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,320
in just a few years, there'll be no more

29
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,320
Facebook in just a few years.

30
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,180
So Facebook researchers saw this, and they had to respond,

31
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,060
of course, firmly tongue in cheek.

32
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,510
And they put the following blog post with the following

33
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,910
conclusion, which is "in keeping with the scientific principle

34
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:50,830
'correlation equals causation,' our research unequivocally

35
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,610
demonstrated that Princeton may be in danger of disappearing

36
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,950
entirely."

37
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,010
So how did they arrive at this conclusion?

38
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,190
They looked at the proportion of total page likes

39
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,410
for Princeton, Harvard, and Yale.

40
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:04,910
In The.

41
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,060
Graph on the bottom, we can see that there's

42
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,180
a steady increase in total page lakes for Yale,

43
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,520
with a slight decrease in 2014.

44
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,560
Harvard shows substantial growth up until about 2012,

45
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,370
and then there's a declining trend.

46
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:27,720
But Princeton shows a sharp decline from 2009 to 2010,

47
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,060
with a slight recovery from 2010 to 2014,

48
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,235
and then a slight decline.

49
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:36,000


50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,100
Looking at this Princeton search trends,

51
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,190
they extrapolate that this trend suggests

52
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,690
that Princeton will have only half of its current enrollment

53
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,060
by 2018.

54
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,690
And by 2021, it will have no students at all.

55
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,160
Now, of course, since all of this

56
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,100
was tongue in cheek in terms of the response,

57
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,180
they went further.

58
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,400
And they say, "While we're concerned for Princeton

59
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,129
University, we are even more concerned

60
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:00,670
about the fate of the planet, because Google Trends for 'air'

61
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,250
have also been climbing steadily,

62
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,680
and our projection show that by the year 2060,

63
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,250
there we know air left at all."

64
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:12,940
And they produce this graph of interest over time in air.
