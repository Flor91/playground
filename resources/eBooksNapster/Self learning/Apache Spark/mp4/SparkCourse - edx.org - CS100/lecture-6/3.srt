1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,990
Here are some examples of large databases.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,760
The United States Internal Revenue Service

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:11,780
has a database consisting of 150 terabytes worth of taxpayer

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,310
records.

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,330
The Australian Bureau of Statistics

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,620
has over 250 terabytes worth of vital statistics

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,135
about Australians.

8
00:00:21,135 --> 00:00:26,580
And AT&T has over 312 terabytes worth of call records

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,860
for all of its callers.

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,540
eBay's database, its largest database,

11
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:35,710
is over 1.4 petabytes in size.

12
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,630
And Yahoo has a click database that's

13
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:44,480
used for behavioral tracking that contains over two

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,545
petabytes worth of data.

15
00:00:46,545 --> 00:00:48,170
Now, for each of these large databases,

16
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:52,130
we can ask the question, what matters for these databases?

17
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,820
In the case of the IRS, they care

18
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,850
about accuracy, consistency, durability, and the ability

19
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,120
to make rich queries.

20
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,070
The Australian Bureau of Statistics

21
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,200
cares about fast, rich queries.

22
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,420
AT&T, for their call records database,

23
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,310
cares about accuracy, consistency, and durability.

24
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,570
eBay and Yahoo care about availability and timeliness

25
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,200
for their databases.

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,700
