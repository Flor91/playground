1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,330
SQL allows you to explicitly state the type of JOIN

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:05,670
that you want to perform.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,780
So in this case, we have stated that we

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:12,710
want to SELECT S.name and E.classid FROM Students S

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:18,960
INNER JOIN Enrolled E ON S.sid equals E.sid.

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,210
This is the same as what we saw earlier.

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,330
It will combine the two tables, the Cartesian product,

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,700
and then select those tuples where S.sid equals E.sid.

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,270


10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,240
Now, all of these are equivalent JOIN notations.

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,570
But the explicit versions are preferred.

12
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,570
In the explicit case, we have the example that we just saw,

13
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:47,360
SELECT S.name and E.classid FROM Students S

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,140
INNER JOIN Enrolled E ON S.sid equals E.sid,

15
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:57,580
or we can actually drop the keyword INNER as the default

16
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,080
JOIN is an INNER JOIN.

17
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,330
Now what we saw in the earlier example

18
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,349
was implicit JOIN notation.

19
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,900
But this has since been deprecated,

20
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,400
and so you shouldn't use it anymore.

21
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,430
Instead, you should explicitly say either INNER JOIN

22
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,134
or JOINED.

23
00:01:12,134 --> 00:01:12,633
