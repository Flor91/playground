1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,810
The structured query language, or SQL,

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,610
is a language for relational databases.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,500
It's supported in pi spark by data frames.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,080
And some of functionality that's SQL provides

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,690
is the ability to create, modify, and delete relations,

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,220
to add, modify, and remove tuples,

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,180
and to specify queries to find tuples matching criteria.

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,110
Let's look at this last functionality item,

9
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,679
specifying queries to find tuples that

10
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:29,845
match a particular criteria.

11
00:00:29,845 --> 00:00:33,160


12
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,550
Single table queries are very straightforward in SQL.

13
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,060
To find all 18-year-old students,

14
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,080
we can write a select star from students s,

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,250
where s.age equals 18.

16
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,530
If we just want to find the names and logins,

17
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,340
we would write instead, select s.name comma, select,

18
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:58,533
.login from students s, where s.age equals 18.

19
00:00:58,533 --> 00:00:59,033
