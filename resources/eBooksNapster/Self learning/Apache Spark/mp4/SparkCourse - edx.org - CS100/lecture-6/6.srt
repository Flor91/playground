00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,180


1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:05,130
We can specify a join over two tables as follows.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,039
We have the table Enrolled E and Students S.

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,590
And we perform the following query.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:17,620
SELECT S.name and E.cid FROM Students S and Enrolled E WHERE

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,045
S.sid equals E.sid.

6
00:00:21,045 --> 00:00:22,920
Now, the first that the system is going to do

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,840
is to combine the two tables, S and E. It's

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,400
going to do this by performing a Cartesian product of the two

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,550
tables.

10
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,900
It'll do this by taking all the rows from E

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,890
and combining them with all of the rows from S.

12
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,730
And we will end up with the following table.

13
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,190
The next step is to use the WHERE

14
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,110
clause to select matching rows.

15
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,620
So in this case, it's where S.sid equals E.sid.

16
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,640
And we can see that there are two rows.

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,670
The next step is to filter columns

18
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,810
using the SELECT clause.

19
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:04,700
And the SELECT clause, here, is S.name and E.cid.

20
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,830
So now, we are able to return the result, which

21
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:13,720
is two tuples-- Jones and History 105 and Smith

22
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,500
and Physics 203.

23
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,000
