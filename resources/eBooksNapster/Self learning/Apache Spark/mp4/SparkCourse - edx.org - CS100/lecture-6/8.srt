1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:04,260
SQL provides support for multiple types of joins.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,340
The type of the join controls how unmatched keys are handled.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,570
Here we have an inner join, and it's

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,370
between two tables, students S, and enrolled E.

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,530
We can see in the table S, that there's

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,460
an unmatched key, brown.

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,550
And we can see in the table E, that there's an unmatched

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,140
key for English 10.

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,520
When producing the result, an inner join

10
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,790
will not include any tuples for which there's not a matching

11
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,350
key in the other relation.

12
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,520


13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,540
The second type that we want to look at is a left outer join.

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,650
With a left outer join, if a key appears in the left table,

15
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,870
in this case, students S, but not in the right table,

16
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,980
in this case, enrolled E, then the key

17
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,630
is included, but with the value null.

18
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:59,150
So in this case, brown appears in the result,

19
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,110
but with a class ID that's null.

20
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,850


21
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,390
The third and last case that we can look at

22
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,520
is a right outer join.

23
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,950
With a right outer join, if a key appears in the right table,

24
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:16,580
in this case, enrolled E, but not in the left table,

25
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,760
in this case, students S, then the key

26
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,970
is included, but with the value null.

27
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,410
So in this case, English 10 is included as the class ID,

28
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,200
but the name is null.
