00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,670
Many statistical tools, for example mean,

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,430
variance, t-test, ANOVA, assume the data is normally

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,350
distributed.

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:10,380
But very often, this is not the case.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,620
So it's important to examine the histogram for your data set.

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,120
On the left, we have a curve that

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,390
is a normal distribution curve.

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,290
In the middle, we have a histogram

9
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,490
representing a positive skew in the data set.

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,230
And on the right curve, we have an example of negative skew

11
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,000
in a data set.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,600
Now, there are other distributions

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,190
that are important that you will likely encounter in your work

14
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,630
with big data.

15
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,449
These include Poisson distributions.

16
00:00:37,449 --> 00:00:39,240
These are a distribution of the counts that

17
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,650
occur at a certain rate, for example,

18
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:45,240
the observed frequency of a given term in a corpus,

19
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,030
or the number of visits to a website in a fixed time

20
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,060
interval, or the number of website clicks in an hour.

21
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,070
Another example of an important distribution is exponential.

22
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,470
And this is the interval between two such events

23
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,495
that you might see in a Poisson distribution.

24
00:00:59,495 --> 00:01:02,280


25
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,099
Zipf, Pareto, and Yule distributions

26
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,930
govern the frequencies of different terms

27
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,970
in a document or website visits.

28
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,990
And binomial or multinomial distributions

29
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,170
are a number of counts of events,

30
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,260
for example, the number of six dies that show up

31
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,846
when you toss them n times.

32
00:01:20,846 --> 00:01:22,220
It's very important to understand

33
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,880
your data's distribution before you

34
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,050
apply any model to that data.
