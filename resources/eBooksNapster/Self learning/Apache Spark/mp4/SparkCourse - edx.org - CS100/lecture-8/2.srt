00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,840
In big data there are two different kinds

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,940
of statistics that are very important,

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,250
descriptive and inferential.

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,040
With descriptive statistics, an example is the median.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,070
Descriptive statistics describes the data,

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,310
but we can't generalize beyond that.

7
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,490
In this lecture, we'll look at exploratory data analysis,

8
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,700
which is a form of descriptive statistics.

9
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,180
Inferential statistics, examples are the t-test-- enable

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,112
inferences about populations beyond our data.

11
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:30,570
These are techniques that we leverage from machine learning

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,170
and prediction.

13
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,000
Examples of the kinds of business questions

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,450
we might want to ask include things like simple descriptive

15
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:39,480
statistics.

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,510
For example, who are the most profitable customers?

17
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,590
Or hypothesis testing.

18
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,880
Is there a difference in value to the company

19
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,540
of these different customers?

20
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,680
Or segmentation and classification.

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,340
What are the common characteristics

22
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,150
of these customers?

23
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,320
And finally prediction.

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,260
Will this new customer become a profitable customer?

25
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,480
And if so, how profitable?

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,670


27
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,460
We can apply these techniques in different ways.

28
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,200
Often, the kinds of questions that we

29
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,910
ask when we ask business questions are very casual.

30
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,200
What would happen if I show this ad?

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,670
It's often easier to ask correlational questions

32
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,456
such as, what happened in the past when I showed this ad.

33
00:01:19,456 --> 00:01:20,830
Now there are two different forms

34
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,750
of learning that are interesting for big data.

35
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,160
There is supervised learning which is classification

36
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,340
and regression, and there's unsupervised

37
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,180
learning which is clustering and dimension reduction.

38
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,730
Now oftentimes we use unsupervised learning

39
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,420
inside a larger supervised learning problem.

40
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,274
So for example, auto-encoders are used for image recognition

41
00:01:39,274 --> 00:01:39,940
neural networks.

42
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,459


43
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:45,000
Now here's some examples of the different learning techniques

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,760
that we might try to apply.

45
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,390
They fall again into the categories

46
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,633
of supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

47
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:52,133
