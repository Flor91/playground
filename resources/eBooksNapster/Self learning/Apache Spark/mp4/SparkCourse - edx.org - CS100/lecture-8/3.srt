1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,640
Exploratory data analysis is based

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,686
on insights that were developed at Bell Labs in the 1960s.

3
00:00:07,686 --> 00:00:09,810
They are techniques for visualizing and summarizing

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,740
data.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,110
For example, what can the data tell us?

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,230
Now this is in contrast to confirmatory data analysis

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,220
where we already know what we're looking for

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,140
and we simply want to look at the data

9
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,130
and understand whether or not it confirms what we expect to see.

10
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,560
Exploratory data analysis introduced

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,050
many basic techniques, including the five-number summary,

12
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,550
box plots, and stem and leaf diagrams amongst other things.

13
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,120
Five-number summary is a way of looking

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,380
at the data in terms of its statistics

15
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,940
and includes looking at the extremes, the minimum

16
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,769
and the maximum, the median and quartiles.

17
00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:46,310
And it's a technique that's much more

18
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,560
robust to skewed and long-tailed distributions

19
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,950
and looking at just simple statistics instead.

20
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:56,030
This was summarized in a book that was published in 1977.

21
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:00,220
So let's look at an example of a data set.

22
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,185
And this data set is called Anscombe's Quartet

23
00:01:02,185 --> 00:01:04,550
and was developed in 1973.

24
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,770
We have four different data sets.

25
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,400
Set A, set B, set C, and set D.

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,730
Now the properties of each set are identical.

27
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:20,640
In particular, the mean of x in all of the sets is 9.

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,890
The sample variance of x is 11 in all of the data sets.

29
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,760
The mean of y is 7.5.

30
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,990
And the sample variance of y is 4.122.

31
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,130
You can fit a line to all of these data

32
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,470
sets using linear regression.

33
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,150
And that line would be identical.

34
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,890
y equals 3 plus 0.5x.

35
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,250
But what happens if we actually plot the data sets?

36
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,040
Wow.

37
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,820
We see that they're actually quite different.

38
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,400
So the takeaway here is that it's very important

39
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,000
to look at data graphically before you actually analyze it.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,400
And basic statistics properties will often

41
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,780
fail to capture real-world complexities.

42
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,810
Here's another example.

43
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,380
This is a picture that was produced by Facebook

44
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,930
by plotting the friendship relationships of individuals

45
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,380
that are part of Facebook.

46
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,870
And they did that using Geotag information.

47
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,460
This kind of data art is actually

48
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,410
really quite fascinating.

49
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,800
You can see the continents here.

50
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,100
You can see countries.

51
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,410
You can see cities.

52
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,980
Even though they did not actually

53
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,000
use a world map when they plotted this,

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,660
they merely plotted the Geotag information.

55
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,820
So this is an example of how visualizing the data sets

56
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,310
can yield much more insights than simply just trying

57
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,070
to look at the underlying numbers that

58
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,333
are contained in the data set.

59
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:48,833
