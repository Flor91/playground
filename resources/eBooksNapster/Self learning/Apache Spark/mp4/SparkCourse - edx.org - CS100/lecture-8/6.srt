Joseph Rhine was a parapsychologist in the 1950s.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,980
He performed the following experiment.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,280
He had subjects guess whether 10 hidden cards were red or blue.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,730
He found that about one person in 1,000

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,110
had extrasensory perception.

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:20,310
They could correctly guess the color of all 10 cards.

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,990
They called back these psychic subjects

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,540
and had them repeat the test.

9
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,230
They all failed.

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,400
He concluded that the act of telling psychics

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,380
that they have psychic abilities causes them to lose it.

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,380
So what was wrong with his conclusion?

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,670
While it is the case that correlation does not

14
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,490
imply causation, that's not the problem here.

15
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,720
The real problem is, think about how many combinations

16
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,850
there are red and blue cards of length 10.

17
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:55,410
There's 2 the 10th power, or 1,024 combinations.

18
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,230
So there's a 0.98 probability that at least one subject

19
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:04,040
in 1,000 will guess correctly, which

20
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,772
is exactly what he observed.

21
00:01:05,772 --> 00:01:07,230
And if you bring that subject back,

22
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,740
it's extremely unlikely-- very low probability--

23
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,600
that they'd be able to repeat that same observation.

24
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,267
