00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,300


1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,210
Now that we have VirtualBox and Vagrant installed,

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,770
we're going to go and download the box.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,720


4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,890
So first off, what we basically have to do

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,960
is download a zip file that's going

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,430
to contain a Vagrant file, a file which is what we require

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,745
to interact with Vagrant.

8
00:00:22,745 --> 00:00:26,190


9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,830
Here's the address here of the zip file

10
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:28,955
that we need to go get.

11
00:00:28,955 --> 00:00:36,910


12
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:59,834
Github.com/spark mooc/mooc setup/archive/master.zip

13
00:00:59,834 --> 00:01:02,650
We're going to choose to save the file.

14
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:09,660


15
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,165
Now, I'm going to open a terminal.

16
00:01:11,165 --> 00:01:21,570


17
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,740
My file has downloaded into my downloads folder.

18
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,560
I'm going to unzip it here.

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,520


20
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,990
So we see a Vagrant file, and also a VM

21
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,450
test student IPython notebook which

22
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,950
will be used at a later time.

23
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,194


24
00:01:42,194 --> 00:01:43,610
So what I'm going to be doing here

25
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:48,460
is just create some folder.

26
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,370
It's your choice, I'm just going to call it myvagrant.

27
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:56,000


28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,070
And then I will CD into that directory,

29
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:16,445
and I will copy the Vagrant file.

30
00:02:16,445 --> 00:02:19,560
Oh, sorry.

31
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:28,476
It's actually in downloads, mooc set up master vagrant.

32
00:02:28,476 --> 00:02:33,200


33
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,740
I'm going to copy that file here, typo.

34
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:47,130


35
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,810
So now I have my vagrant file here.

36
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,600


37
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,995
From this point, I simply need to do a Vagrant up.

38
00:02:56,995 --> 00:03:01,370


39
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:07,246
And this will go and download the box with the spark

40
00:03:07,246 --> 00:03:07,745
that I need.

41
00:03:07,745 --> 00:03:15,290


42
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,680
And it's-- I've edited the video a bit here,

43
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,110
so it did take several minutes for the whole download

44
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:27,480
and everything to happen, but I've edited the video just

45
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,000
to remove that so you're not necessarily sitting here

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,500
waiting.

47
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:40,605


48
00:03:40,605 --> 00:03:42,230
So what I'm going to do now is I'm just

49
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:47,230
going to go up here, go to VirtualBox.

50
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:56,060


51
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:01,430
OK, so what we see here is a Spark VM VM, and it's running.

52
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:08,012
