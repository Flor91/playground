1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:03,730
Let's look at a real world example.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,630
Here's a graph of ages of students that are actually

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,720
taking this course.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,820
On the x-axis, we have ages.

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,020
And on the y-axis, we have account of students.

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,211
So what's wrong with this data?

7
00:00:16,211 --> 00:00:17,710
Well, if we look very closely, we'll

8
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:24,290
see that we have 109 students that are under the age of five.

9
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:31,240
And we have 26 students that are over the age of 100.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,180
The problem here is that this data

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,480
is based on self-reported ages.

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,150
So if we were to just blindly import

13
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,860
this data into an analytics pipeline and try to process it,

14
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,550
we'd run into a number of significant problems

15
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,867
and challenges.

16
00:00:45,867 --> 00:00:46,367
