00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,990


1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,000
You should use a multi-disciplinary approach

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,680
when attacking data quality problems because no one

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,290
approach will solve all of the problems.

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,540
As an example of some of the disciplines that you want

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,470
to use, they include process management--

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,010
ensuring that you have the proper procedures.

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,070
Statistics-- focusing on analysis

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,480
that you can find and repair anomalies in the data.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,332
Database management techniques, so you

10
00:00:23,332 --> 00:00:26,300
can focus on relationships to ensure consistency.

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,400
And metadata and domain expertise-- what does this data

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,700
mean, or how do you interpret this data?

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,670
The data quality issues could also

14
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,159
be introduced during data integration

15
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:38,950
when you're combining data sets that you've

16
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,200
acquired or collected across departments.

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,980
This is a very common source of problems

18
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,510
because oftentimes you have heterogeneous data.

19
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,490
There might not be a common key, or there

20
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,301
may be different field formats.

21
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,550
In this case, you may have to apply a technique called

22
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,576
approximate matching.

23
00:00:55,576 --> 00:00:57,200
There may also be different definitions

24
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,770
of what is a customer.

25
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,010
In one data set, it may be an account.

26
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,010
In another data set, it might be an individual.

27
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,920
And in the third data set, it might be a family.

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,090
Time synchronization can also be a problem

29
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,740
during data integration.

30
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,310
Does the data relate to the same time periods,

31
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,970
or are the time windows compatible?

32
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,820
Another integration challenge is when

33
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,680
you have legacy data, data that's

34
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,320
coming from different spreadsheets

35
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,840
and different formats, or files with ad hoc structures.

36
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,400
A challenge that we have during data integration

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,150
is duplicate record detection, or DeDup.

38
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,990
Examples are resolving multiple different entries,

39
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,910
identifying what is an appropriate entity

40
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:43,720
or a matching entity, or determining

41
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,060
which references are correct, or which object

42
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,550
ID should be consolidated.

43
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,240
Or removing duplicates by merging or purging

44
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,750
values in the data set, or linking together

45
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,910
records spanning across different data sources,

46
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,570
or performing approximate matches,

47
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:03,740
where we accept fuzziness instead of an exact match.

48
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,810
Or householding-- this is a special case where

49
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,250
we try to determine things like, are different people

50
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,500
in the same household?

51
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,940
Here's an example of entity resolution.

52
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,630
These are two listings that we scraped

53
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,880
from Google and from Amazon.

54
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,140
Are these two listings the same product?

55
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,820
They appear very similar.

56
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,800
In fact, they are the same product.

57
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,470
In the lab, you'll look at an algorithmic approach

58
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,867
to doing entity resolution.

59
00:02:31,867 --> 00:02:32,367
