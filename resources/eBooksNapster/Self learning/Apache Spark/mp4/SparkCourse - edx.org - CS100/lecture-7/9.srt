1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:04,660
Data quality problems can be introduced during data storage.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:05,700
So you have a data set.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,930
What do you do with it?

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:07,990
You store it.

5
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,220
But there can be problems in the physical storage of that data.

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,090
Now, this is a potential issue, but storage is cheap.

7
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:19,140
And so we should store redundantly as an example.

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,820
So some of problems that we can run into in storage

9
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,500
are logical, for example, having poor metadata.

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,300
So when we have data feeds that are

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,250
derived from programs or legacy sources, what does it mean?

12
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,540
If we don't understand what the metadata is for these programs,

13
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,430
we can't understand what the quality of the data is.

14
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,510
Also, having an inappropriate data model

15
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,290
is a problem if you don't have the right timestamps

16
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,590
or the correct normalization of the data.

17
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,210
Or if you make ad-hoc modifications to the data,

18
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,710
changing the structure, for example,

19
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,790
to fit the graphical user interface that you

20
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,530
use to explore the data.

21
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,230
Or if you have hardware or software constraints.

22
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,340
For example, transmitting the data via Excel spreadsheets

23
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,980
or running into Y2K, Year 2000 problems,

24
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,560
because you chose to use two-digit years instead

25
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,370
of four-digit years.

26
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,080
Potential solutions are to make sure

27
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,280
that you document and publish the data specifications.

28
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,180
Track that metadata very carefully.

29
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,620
Good planning can also help.

30
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,420
Assume that everything bad will happen and then plan for it.

31
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,920
This can be very difficult, however,

32
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,840
to anticipate all of the potential problems.

33
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,090
Also consider using data exploration.

34
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,116
Browse the data or use data mining tools

35
00:01:35,116 --> 00:01:36,490
to examine the data and make sure

36
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:39,480
that it meets the specifications that you've assumed

37
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,067
or to determine, has something changed that you didn't expect?

38
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:43,567
