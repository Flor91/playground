00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,090


1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:03,620
Data quality issues could also be introduced

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,060
during data delivery-- for example,

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,290
destroying, mutilating information

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,310
through bad preprocessing.

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,800
As examples, inappropriate aggregation

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,010
or incorrectly converting null values into default values.

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,770
It can also happen due to the loss

8
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,000
of data-- say from a buffer overflow or transmission

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,420
problem, or a lack of integrity checks.

10
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,070
Potential solutions to the data delivery problem

11
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,930
are to build reliable transmission protocols.

12
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,700
Use a relay server to store data and verify it

13
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,350
before it's inserted into the data set.

14
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:40,570
Use checksums or a verification parser for verification.

15
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,940
Determine does the uploaded file actually fit

16
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,820
the expected pattern?

17
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,360
Examine the relationships.

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,440
These are the dependencies between data streams

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,440
and preprocessing steps.

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,790
And ask your data supplier to provide you

21
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,050
with a commitment around the quality of data

22
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,668
that they're providing.

23
00:00:57,668 --> 00:00:58,167
