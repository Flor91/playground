1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:04,570
Here's an example of a system log file from a machine.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,540
And you can see that there are multiple applications running

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,830
on this machine.

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,655
And you can also see some of the system operations

5
00:00:11,655 --> 00:00:13,860
that are happening on this machine.

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,270
Now, we can collect these types of files from many machines

7
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,810
and then check them for unusual events, like disk

8
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,880
errors, network congestion, or security attacks.

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,440
We can also monitor the resources on the machines

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,340
from these files, looking at things

11
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,510
like the network, the memory, the disc, the CPU,

12
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,240
or application queues.

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,740
We can take all of that information,

14
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,140
and we can visualize it with a dashboard.

15
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,230
So for example, here us a dashboard

16
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,200
from Splunk, which provides a free version of its Enterprise

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,710
software that you can download and try with your own data.
