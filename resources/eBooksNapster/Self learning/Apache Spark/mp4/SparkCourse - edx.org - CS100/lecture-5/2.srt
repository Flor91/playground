00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,410


1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,825
So in review, the big picture is we have a data warehouse,

2
00:00:04,825 --> 00:00:06,200
and from that data warehouse we'd

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,380
like to extract data products, analytics,

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,210
and business intelligence.

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,780
We get information into the data warehouse

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,340
by performing extract, transform, and load operations

7
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:22,020
on application databases, files, and logs.

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,520
Now, some of the key data management

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,460
concepts that we want to consider are a data model.

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,540
This is a collection of concepts for describing

11
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,930
data and a schema, which is a description

12
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,930
of a particular collection of data using a given data model.

13
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,230
Now, information spans a structure spectrum,

14
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,640
ranging from unstructured, or schema-never data.

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,050
This is information that has no structure

16
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,620
and never will have structure.

17
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,850
It includes things like plain text and media.

18
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,790
Semi-structured, or structure-later data,

19
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:57,080
includes things like documents, Extensible Markup Language

20
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,370
content, and tag text, or media.

21
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,400
The last structure element is structured data,

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,270
and this is schema-first data.

23
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,480
This includes things like relational databases

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,680
and formatted messages.

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,090
Today, we will look at semi-structured data

26
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,180
or schema-later data, where we apply a schema

27
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,100
after we create that data.
