1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,020
In one of the labs for this course

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,030
you'll be exploring a web server access log from NASA,

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,570
the space agency in America.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,960
This log covers 21 days and includes

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,050
over a million requests.

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,960
We've partially cleaned the log for you

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,240
to help you by removing some of the very hard to parse

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,940
requests.

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,460
Now, with a log like this there are many different questions

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,790
that you could ask.

11
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,097
For example, what are the statistics

12
00:00:27,097 --> 00:00:28,680
for the content that's being returned,

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,190
the sizes, or the statuses?

14
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,820
What types of return codes occur?

15
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,760
How many 404-- that's page not found errors-- are there?

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,510
Those are important because that indicates

17
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,560
that someone wasn't able to find something

18
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,230
that they were looking for.

19
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,480
But you can also ask a lot of temporal questions,

20
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,370
like how many unique hosts were there per day?

21
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,210
Or how many requests were there per day?

22
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,430
Or on average, how many requests were there per host?

23
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,130
Or how many 404 errors were there on a daily basis?
