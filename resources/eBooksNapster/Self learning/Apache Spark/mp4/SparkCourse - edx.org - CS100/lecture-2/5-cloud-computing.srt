00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,680


1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,489
Cloud computing is a key enabler of data science.

2
00:00:03,489 --> 00:00:05,780
Instead of going out and purchasing your own computers,

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,029
and then having to pay to operate those computers

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:10,230
and maintain them, with Cloud computing,

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,210
you rent computers from a Cloud computing provider.

6
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,770
This allows you to reduce overall computing costs,

7
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,590
and in particular, your operating costs for computing.

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,940
Cloud computing enables you to perform data science

9
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,680
on a massive scale, because you can

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,570
rent huge numbers of inexpensive computers,

11
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,340
perform a problem, exploration, and then

12
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,729
shut down those computers and stop paying for them.

13
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,640
Now to make this possible, Cloud computing providers are

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,520
building massive data centers, data

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,630
centers that have hundreds of thousands,

16
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,255
or even a million servers in them.

17
00:00:44,255 --> 00:00:48,300
Now there are many challenges to building a data center

18
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,220
that contains a million servers, including cooling,

19
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,160
the building itself, and power, and how you actually organize

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,650
the computers into modules.

21
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,540
But people are performing research exactly in engineering

22
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,790
and how to build these things.

23
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,750
And they are building these data centers.

24
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,490
This is driving down the cost of Cloud computing.
