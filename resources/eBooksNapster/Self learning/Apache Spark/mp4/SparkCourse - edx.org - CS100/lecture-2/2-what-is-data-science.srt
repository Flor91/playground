00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,740


1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,080
So what is data science?

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,380
Well, according to O'Reilly, data science

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,330
aims to drive knowledge from big data

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,540
efficiently and intelligently.

5
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,280
Data science encompasses the set of activities, tools,

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,710
and methods that enable data-driven activities

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,900
in science, business, medicine, and government.

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,990
Here's another definition of data science.

9
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:24,290
Data science combines three different skills-- hacking

10
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:28,420
skills, math and statistics knowledge, and domain expertise

11
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,710
skills.

12
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,119
Now this leads to some interesting intersections.

13
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,760
For example, between hacking skills and math and statistics

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,120
knowledge, we have traditional machine learning.

15
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,911
So this is the case where you have somebody

16
00:00:39,911 --> 00:00:44,790
who can apply algorithms at scale to large amounts of data,

17
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,190
and understand both the algorithms and the results

18
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,290
that they see from those algorithms.

19
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,180
Combining the skills of math and statistics

20
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,640
knowledge with domain expertise, we have traditional research.

21
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,230
So this is where someone in a specific domain

22
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,260
is able to collect some data, and then

23
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,580
perform detailed analyses on that data,

24
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,420
understanding both the analytical process

25
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,740
and the results that they get.

26
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,450
The danger zone is someone who has hacking skills and domain

27
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:12,604
expertise skills.

28
00:01:12,604 --> 00:01:14,020
In this case, you have someone who

29
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,450
is able to collect a lot of domain-specific knowledge,

30
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,360
apply algorithms to that at scale,

31
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,730
but doesn't really understand either the algorithms

32
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,847
or the results that they get from applying those algorithms.

33
00:01:25,847 --> 00:01:27,430
So if you remember the cautionary tale

34
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,330
from last time about the Facebook analysis,

35
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,260
that's a case where someone applied hacking skills

36
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,460
to a large amount of domain-specific information,

37
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,180
and yielded a result that they didn't really understand.

38
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,560
The combination of hacking skills, math and statistics

39
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,220
knowledge, and domain expertise yields data science.

40
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,400
Someone who can apply domain-specific knowledge

41
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,520
at very large scale, while understanding

42
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,390
both the algorithms that they're applying,

43
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,090
and the results that they get from applying those algorithms.

44
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,200
