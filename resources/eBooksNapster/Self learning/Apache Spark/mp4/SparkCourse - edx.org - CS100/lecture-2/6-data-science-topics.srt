00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,860


1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,670
So what does a data scientist do in practice?

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,580
Well, first, they start by digging around in data,

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,390
trying to find interesting data to analyze.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,090
And that's why I have a picture here of some kids panning

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,400
for gold, trying to find those little nuggets in a lot of dirt

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,340
and dirty water.

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,860
So the next step is that they have

8
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,720
to clean and prepare that data.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,170
And then they hypothesize a model.

10
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,400
So they think about what they think

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,800
might be some interesting properties of the data

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,760
and build a model.

13
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,470
They then evaluate and interpret the results of that model.

14
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,510
And oftentimes, you don't get what you expected.

15
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,370
And so you have to go back and collect more data

16
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,280
and repeat the cycle of cleaning, preparing that data,

17
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,970
hypothesizing a new model or maybe a hybrid of your old

18
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:47,470
and new or some composite model, and then evaluate and interpret

19
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,940
the results from that, and then repeat, and repeat, and repeat.

20
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,160
Until finally, you have a model that you

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,970
think gives you interesting statistically

22
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,750
significant results.

23
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,150
And then you want to run that model at massive scale.

24
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:05,390
And so this is where large scale exploitation comes into play.

25
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,080
Now, some of the topics for data scientists

26
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,240
include data acquisition, data preparation, analysis,

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,030
data presentation, data products, and observation

28
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:18,863
and experimentation.

29
00:01:18,863 --> 00:01:21,810


30
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,550
Now, what makes data science difficult?

31
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:25,730
Many things.

32
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:29,990
First, we have to overcome assumptions

33
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,830
and making ad hoc explanations of data patterns.

34
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,350
And this is just human nature.

35
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:39,500
When we see something, we immediately see a pattern.

36
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,540
It's very hard for us to overcome that pattern

37
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,240
that we saw and really understand,

38
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,480
was that just something sort of like an optical illusion,

39
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,090
or was it really a significant pattern?

40
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,470
We also have to be very careful about just, well,

41
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,390
we think it might be this because.

42
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,890
Those kind of ad hoc explanations

43
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,720
aren't scientifically valid.

44
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,480
We also have to make sure we check,

45
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,510
and we check, and we check again.

46
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,930
We need to validate our models, validate

47
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,800
the integrity of our data pipeline, and so on.

48
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,370
So think about the Google Flu Trends results.

49
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,130
Initially, they had a very accurate model.

50
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:19,506
But over time, the model became very inaccurate.

51
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,380
And this is because the underlying conditions

52
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,970
changed, flu stories appearing on Google News.

53
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,840
They had to go back and revalidate their models

54
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,870
and revalidate their data pipeline.

55
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,360
And then they got great results again.

56
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,260
We also have to be very careful about overgeneralizing,

57
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,780
that is taking a model and trying to apply it everywhere.

58
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,280
Another hard thing for data science

59
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,610
is communicating our results.

60
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,350
How do you convey the results of your model

61
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,980
to someone who's not a domain expert

62
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,850
or who does not understand statistical methods?

63
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,180
And related to this is we have to make sure that we use

64
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,960
statistical tests correctly.

65
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,330
Again, think about the caveat example

66
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,850
with Facebook, where the researchers did not correctly

67
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,870
apply statistical techniques.

68
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,850
Another challenge is moving from a prototype

69
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,140
model into something that you can run in production

70
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,280
and can actually handle massive amounts of data

71
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,610
and deliver results nearly instantaneously.

72
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,030
And finally, data pipelines can be very complex,

73
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:26,460
lots of moving parts for many different projects and sources.

74
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,630
And so when something goes wrong, who do you ask for help?
