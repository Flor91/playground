1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:04,770
Spark transformations enable us to create new data sets

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,640
from an existing one.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,580
Again, we're using lazy evaluations.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,970
That means that results are not computed right away.

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,830
Instead, what happens is Spark remembers

6
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:17,040
the set of transformations that are applied to a base data set.

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,620
It can then optimize the required calculations

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,850
and automatically recover from failures and slow workers.

9
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,740
The way to think about this is we're creating a recipe

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,430
for creating a result.

11
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,689
So let's look at some examples of transformations.

12
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:36,320
There's the map transformation, the filter, distinct,

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,290
and flatMap transformations.

14
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,220
The map transformation returns a new distributed data set

15
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,940
that's formed by passing each element of the source

16
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,440
through a function.

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,290
Filter returns a new data set that's

18
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,730
formed by selecting those elements of the source on which

19
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,170
the function returns true.

20
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,650
And the distinct transformation returns a new data set

21
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:00,990
that contains the distinct elements of the source data

22
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,290
set.

23
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,040
The flatMap transformation is similar to map,

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,320
but each input element can be mapped to zero or more output

25
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,300
elements.

26
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,370
So this means that your function should return a sequence rather

27
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,650
than a single item.
