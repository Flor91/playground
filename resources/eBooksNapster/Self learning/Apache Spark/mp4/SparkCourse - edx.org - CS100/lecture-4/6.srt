00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,140
Let's review Python's lambda functions.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,690
These are small, anonymous functions

3
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:06,220
that are not bound to a name.

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,320
So here, we have lambda a comma b colon a plus b.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,840
This returns the sum of its two arguments, a and b.

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,000
You can use lambda functions wherever function objects are

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,267
required, but they're restricted to a single expression.

00:00:20,267 --> 00:00:20,767
