1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:03,620
So what's hard about cluster computing?

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:08,390
One challenge is how do we split work across machines?

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,090
Let's look at an example.

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,380
How do we count the number of occurrences

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,590
of each word in a document?

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,140
So here we have the document, I am Sam.

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,110
I am Sam.

8
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,340
Sam, I am.

9
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,490
Do you like green eggs and ham?

10
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,450
We'd like to count the words.

11
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:26,580
So, for example, there are three occurrences of I,

12
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,310
three occurrences of am, three occurrences of Sam,

13
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:34,410
and one of do, and one of you, and one of like, and so on.

14
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,610
So one approach we could do is to use a hash table.

15
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,380
So here we start with an empty hash table,

16
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,320
and we look at each word.

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,420
So we start with I. I doesn't appear in the hash table,

18
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,300
so we add it with a single occurrence.

19
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,236
We then examine the word am.

20
00:00:51,236 --> 00:00:53,540
Am does not occur in the hash table,

21
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,140
so we add it with one occurrence.

22
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,080
We look at Sam.

23
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,850
Sam occurs not at all in our hash table,

24
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,190
so we add Sam to our hash table with one occurrence.

25
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,650
Now we see I, that appears in our hash table already,

26
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,920
and so we update the value to two.

27
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,740
And we can keep doing this for each

28
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,333
of the words in our document.

29
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:13,833
