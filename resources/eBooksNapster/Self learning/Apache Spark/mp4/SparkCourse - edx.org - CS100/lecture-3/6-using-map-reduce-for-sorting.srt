1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,460
We can use Map Reduce also for sorting.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,280
So here, the Reduce step, we partition

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,610
across the different machines based

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,500
upon the number of occurrences.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,540
This allows us to answer questions

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,600
such as what word is used most?

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,760
So for the first machine, we send

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,710
all of the words that occur two or fewer times.

9
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,730
To the second machine, we send all

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,440
of the words that occur more than two times,

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,090
but four or fewer times.

12
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,930
We send, to the third machine, all

13
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,760
of the words that occur more than four times,

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,660
but five or fewer times.

15
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,080
And to the fourth machine, we send

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,500
all of the words that occur more than five times.

17
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,730


18
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,440
Now, what makes cloud computing difficult?

19
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,660
Well, there are two challenges we have to deal with.

20
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,630
The first is how do we divide work across machines?

21
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,830
We have to consider our network, how it's organized,

22
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,250
how fast it is, or how slow it is.

23
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,910
And we have to consider where data is located, data locality.

24
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,090
Because moving data may be very expensive,

25
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,880
especially if we have a lot of data that has to be moved.

26
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,430
The second thing that makes cluster computing difficult

27
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,380
is dealing with failures.

28
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,770
If a server fails on average every three years,

29
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:27,710
with 10,000 nodes in our cluster we'll see 10 faults per day.

30
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,150
But an even more difficult problem to deal with

31
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,530
is stragglers.

32
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,710
Nodes that have not failed, but are just running very slowly.

33
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,680
Maybe they're about to fail or they have some other problem.

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,350
And that's causing them to perform very slowly.

35
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,620
That's much more common than failures from a node

36
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,500
completely failing.

37
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,000
