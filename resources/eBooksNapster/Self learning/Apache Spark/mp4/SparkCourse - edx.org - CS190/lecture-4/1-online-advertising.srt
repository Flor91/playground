1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,410
In this segment, we'll introduce the topic

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,339
of online advertising.

3
00:00:09,339 --> 00:00:11,630
And we'll also discuss the problem of clickthrough rate

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,140
prediction.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,650
We see online ads all throughout the internet.

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,350
For instance, when I'm reading the news on The New York Times

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,730
website, I sometimes see ads for products

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,740
that might be of interest to me, such as an online store

9
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,400
like Marc Jacobs, that sells watches.

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,640
When performing a web search, I might see ads

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,300
related to my search, and when I search for watches on Google,

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,780
I see additional watch-related advertisements.

13
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,450
In this case, for Fossil watches,

14
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:42,330
and for various online stores, including macys.com.

15
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,290
When I'm reading sports, I also see ads, and in this case,

16
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:49,170
they're ads related to Dr. Pepper.

17
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,710
Overall, online advertising is a multibillion dollar industry,

18
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,410
and it's a growing one.

19
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,150
According to one study, revenue in the US alone was $43 billion

20
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:04,930
in 2013, which is a 17% increase over the previous year.

21
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,530
In the United States, online advertising

22
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,510
has higher revenue than cable TV,

23
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,620
and nearly the same as broadcast TV.

24
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,110
And in particular, a large source of this revenue

25
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,990
comes from search engines like Google.

26
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,080
The goal of online advertising is to have people click on ads

27
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,070
or somehow otherwise engage with ads, and it's a hard problem.

28
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,700
Although user engagement varies by the type of ad,

29
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,240
engagement can be less than 1%.

30
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,380
Advertisers rely on huge amounts of data available to help

31
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,940
improve with user engagement.

32
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,480
This data is generated by measuring

33
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,780
online human activity, in particular, historical data

34
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,650
about how often a user clicked on various ads.

35
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:49,340
And this provides us with a valuable source of label data.

36
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,030
And indeed, online advertising is

37
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,302
this canonical large-scale machine learning problem.

38
00:01:55,302 --> 00:01:57,510
Now let's talk a bit more about the different players

39
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,640
involved in online advertising.

40
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,470
First we have the publishers.

41
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,860
Online sites such as The New York Times, Google, or ESPN.

42
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,060
These publishers make money by displaying ads on their sites.

43
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,039
Second, we have the advertisers.

44
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,640
For instance, companies like Marc Jacobs, Fossil,

45
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,600
Macy's, or Dr. Pepper.

46
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,480
Advertisers are willing to pay for their ads

47
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,960
to be displayed on publishers sites as a way

48
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,160
to attract business.

49
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,260
Third, we have the matchmakers, and these

50
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,060
are companies like Google, Microsoft, or Yahoo

51
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,310
that match publishers with advertisers.

52
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,420
This process often occurs in real time.

53
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,010
So in particular, as a user is visiting a publisher site,

54
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,810
the matchmaker dynamically determines

55
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:43,347
what ad to display on this publisher site.

56
00:02:43,347 --> 00:02:45,430
We've already mentioned that online advertising is

57
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,980
a big business, and as we just discussed,

58
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,200
this money is coming from advertisers.

59
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,092
So it's natural to ask why are advertisers willing to pay?

60
00:02:53,092 --> 00:02:54,800
And there's several different reasons why

61
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,780
they might be willing to pay.

62
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,360
The first is simply for user impressions.

63
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,580
In this case, an advertiser is willing to pay simply

64
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,310
to get their message across to some target audience,

65
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,210
as in the case of a brand awareness campaign.

66
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,300
More often, however, advertisers measure success of an ad

67
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,100
by whether a user is actively engaged with it.

68
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,050
This can mean that a user clicked on the ad

69
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,460
and visited the advertiser's web page,

70
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,640
or even that the user performed some action on the advertiser

71
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,890
web page, such as buying something, or joining a mailing

72
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,440
list.

73
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,020
The most common metric for success

74
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,650
is clickthrough rate prediction.

75
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,320
And this is what we'll be focusing on.

76
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,470
In this pay-per-click setting, an advertiser

77
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:44,290
pays for ad placements only when a user clicks on the ad.

78
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,340
In order to maximize revenue in a pay-per-click setting,

79
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,070
it's crucial for a matchmaker to have

80
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:53,137
a sense of how likely it is for a user to click on an ad.

81
00:03:53,137 --> 00:03:55,470
And this is the crux of the clickthrough rate prediction

82
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,570
problem.

83
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,910
This problem involves estimating a conditional probability,

84
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,150
or the probability of a click event

85
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:06,140
occurring given a set of predicted features.

86
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,160
These features include a variety of information about the ad,

87
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,240
such as its content, its historical performance,

88
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,550
and about the advertiser more generally.

89
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,220
Other information could describe various features

90
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,240
about the specific publisher page

91
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,480
or about the publisher more generally.

92
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,500
And finally, information about the user

93
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,690
is also relevant, such as the user's click history as well as

94
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,760
other information that might be known about the user.

95
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,150
Thankfully, publishers get billions of impressions

96
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,580
each day on their sites.

97
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,310
And this information is readily available.

98
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:43,170
However, the data is high-dimensional, sparse,

99
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,570
and skewed.

100
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,200
There are hundreds of millions, if not

101
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,955
billions of online users.

102
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,250
There are also millions of publisher pages

103
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,780
on which we can display ads, and there are millions

104
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,260
of unique ads to display.

105
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,700
Additionally, only a small fraction of these ads

106
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,740
actually get clicked on by users,

107
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,790
and thus we have a heavily biased label training set.

108
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,680
Hence, it's not easy to find patterns in this data,

109
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,660
and massive data sets are crucial to improve

110
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,157
our predictive capabilities.

111
00:05:11,157 --> 00:05:13,490
In summary, the goal of the clickthrough rate prediction

112
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,830
problem is to use large amounts of data

113
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,140
to estimate the conditional probability that a user will

114
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,940
click on an ad, given features about the user, the ad,

115
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,760
and the publisher.
